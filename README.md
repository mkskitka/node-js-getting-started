1.I do believe everything is working correctly and implemented correctly. 

NOTE *it takes about 10-20seconds for the polylines and landmarks to load on google maps... not sure why this is delayed. 

2.I discussed this assignment with Emily Van Milligan and Olivia McDougal. They helped me with how to get started with the project.
I was helped by a few TA's mostly with some debugging
Ming you helped me. Thanks for helping me find a bug (my dependancies were not all filled in)
I also discussed the purpose of some parameters of some functions with Ben Phander.
3.This assignment took me about 10-12 hours
